# Frontend Rules

- Use React with TypeScript for all components.
- Keep most types in a `types.ts` file and ensure all components are correctly typed.
- Use `react-table` for listing and table features.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use `react-query` for data fetching and caching.
- Favor testable custom hooks for handling fetching logic.
- Write components to be easily testable (e.g., avoid tightly coupling logic and UI, use dependency injection where possible).
