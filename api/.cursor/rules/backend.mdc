# Backend Rules

- Use Python with FastAPI for the backend API.
- Use Pydantic for schema validation and serialization.
- Write tests for each API route (endpoint).
- Use SQLite as the database.
- Use SQLModel as ORM
- Enforce business rules, such as: a user cannot create more than 5 high priority tasks.
